# Introduction


In this project we aim to understand the satisfaction of the customers of a train company without the need of a direct evaluation. To accomplish this task, we will study the provided dataset, “trains_dataset.csv”.

The dataset contains many customer ratings and we hope to predict whether they are satisfied or not, as such this assignment is a regression problem. As such for this assignment we will use linear regression, ridge regression and lasso regression. To do this we shall follow the OSEMN method.

Understanding the customers' satisfaction will help the marketing team to effectively target users with promotions and making the retention higher.
